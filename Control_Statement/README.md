## BREAK Statement

The **break statement** is used to immediately terminate a loop or a switch statement and transfer program control to the next statement following it.

It stops the execution instantly when the specified condition is met.

### Usage
- Used inside loops (for, while, do-while)
- Used in switch statements to prevent fall-through

## CONTINUE Statement
The **continue** statement in java is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move directly to the next iteration.

### Usage
- To skip specific values in a loop
- To control loop flow using conditions
